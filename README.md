# EAI
Er Chang's EAI open source warehouse.

Er Chang EAI has started development in August 2023, and the release time is undecided!

We have pre-developed version 1.0 of EAI on the WeChat Open Platform for Dialogue, but there are some functional flaws.

Of course we also have our website, because we don't have a domain name yet, it has been hosted on SITE123 and Fanke.

However, we chose SITE123 to develop the website.

In addition, considering the network firewall restrictions of users in mainland China and Iran, we have specially prepared a free and practical VPN airport!

This VPN Airport URL:ikuuu.art

In addition, I have prepared two AI navigation stations:
ai-bot.cn
duodaai.com

I will upload the software to the Github warehouse later!

# Version 1.0.0 of Bus Gallery has been released!
Due to limitations of imagica, only English is currently supported. However, our gallery is similar to midjourney, that is, the probability of everyone getting the same picture is only 5%, and only bus pictures can be generated! In addition, I will improve the software, thanks to the existence and support of imagica and fusionapp!
